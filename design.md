# Design

**Theme**: Collaborate with AI  
**Pitch**: You have to climb higher by helping a plant grow in the right direction.  
**Idea**: You need to climb up, but there are no platforms or the platforms are unstable. There is a plant at the bottom of the level that wants to grow and has a behaviour of growing. You can influence it to grow in a way that helps you get up. You need the plant AI's help to get up, and you'll need to help the plant AI to defend it from environmental hazards.

## The Plant

* Following sunlight
### Player Influence

## Game Elements
### Must Have
* Platformer movement (left, right, jucy feeling jump and fall)
* Platforms you can jump up on, and maybe even fall through
* Camera that follows the player
### Should Have
### Could Have
### Won't Have
