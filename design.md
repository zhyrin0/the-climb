# Design

**Theme**: Collaborate with AI  
**Pitch**: You have to climb higher by helping a plant grow in the right direction.  
**Idea**: You need to climb up, but there are no platforms or the platforms are unstable. There is a plant at the bottom of the level that wants to grow and has a behaviour of growing. You can influence it to grow in a way that helps you get up. You need the plant AI's help to get up, and you'll need to help the plant AI to defend it from environmental hazards.

## The Plant
### Default Behaviour
- The plant starts dormant, it needs to be woken up. Sometimes it also gets tired from all the growing :)
- An awake plant starts growing upwards, when it reaches a new uninhabitad platform, it creates an overgrown platform
- A flower that successfully reached a new platfrom blooms fully, and the platform creates a new bud
- Following sunlight
### Player Influence
- Block out sunlight
- Plant grafting to give it different abilities
### Hazards
- Bugs eating the vines
